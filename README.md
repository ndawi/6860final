A model of cyanobacteria growth in lake erie

First a stable model of lake erie is graphed using the predator prey equations
Next the equations are adjusted by adding the exponential growth of cyanobacteria in lake Erie
The result is an unstable model
Next a third species is introduced that is known to prey on the bacteia. 
The model could either be stable or unstable - the results show an unstable environment still

Next a stochastic fluctuation is added to the population throughout the seasons for better accuracy
